Name&Version : 
If you plan to publish your package, the most important things in your package.json are the name and version fields as they will be required.

Main : 
The main field is a module ID that is the primary entry point to your program. That is, if your package is named foo, and a user installs it, and then does require("foo"), then your main module's exports object will be returned.
This should be a module relative to the root of your package folder.

Scripts:
Scripts are something that run at various times in the lifecycle of your package.

Dependencies:
Dependencies are specified in a simple object that maps a package name to a version range. The version range is a string which has one or more space-separated descriptors. Dependencies can also be identified with a tarball or git URL.
These are packages without which our project doesn't run.
npm install --save <package-name>

DevDependencies :
The modules which are needed for the developers in the development mode. 
npm install --save-dev <package-name>

When you do npm install that would be installed as a dependency.
