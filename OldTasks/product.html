      <h3>Android</h3>
      <p>
        Android is an open-source, Linux-based operating system designed
        primarily for touchscreen devices such as smartphones and tablet
        computers. Developed by the Open Handset Alliance, led by Google, and
        other companies, Android provides a unified approach to application
        development for mobile devices. This means developers can create
        applications that run on various Android-powered devices without needing
        to modify their code.
