        The concept of “wonders” has evolved over time, from ancient marvels to
        modern and natural wonders. Here’s a curated selection of remarkable
        sites and structures that showcase human ingenuity, architectural
        achievements, and natural splendor
      </p>
      <p>
        Ancient Wonders: The Great Pyramid of Giza: The last remaining ancient
        wonder, this Egyptian marvel has stood the test of time since 2580 BC.
        Machu Picchu: This Inca citadel in Peru, built around 1450 AD, is an
        engineering feat and a testament to the civilization’s skill. Petra: The
        ancient city in Jordan, carved into sandstone cliffs around 6th century
        BC, is a breathtaking example of Nabataean architecture.
