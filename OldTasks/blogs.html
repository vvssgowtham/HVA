        <p>
          Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a
          shuttlecock across a net. It is a popular recreational activity and
          competitive sport, with various forms of play, including singles and
          doubles. History Badminton originated in the 19th century at Badminton
          House in Gloucestershire, England. The modern version of the game has
          its roots in ancient Greece, China, and India, where similar games
          were played.

        <p>
          A podcast is a series of digital audio files released on a regular
          schedule, typically featuring one or more hosts discussing a
          particular topic or theme. Podcasts combine the intimacy of radio with
          the flexibility of online content, allowing creators to produce shows
          on a wide range of subjects, from science and culture to fiction and
          true crime.
